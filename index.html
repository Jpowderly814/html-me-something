            <h1>My Trip to Santorini</h1>
                <p>In August 2015, I was able to take a trip to Santorini which has been 
                    my favorite vacation.We stayed for 10 days, traveling around the small 
                    island after first stopping in Athens for a day.We were able to stay near 
                    the beach, near the cliffside, and finally in the largest city, Fira.</p>

            <h2>Sailing</h2>
            
                <p>One evening, we embarked on a sunset sail where we enjoed food, drinks, snorkeling, 
                    swimming, and a beautiful view of the sunset.

                <p>Santorini has many wineries to chose from, but we chose to visit one of the larger
                    wineries:Santo.  There was an amazing view of the volcano and we chose a wine tasting 
                    that include a "sampling" of twelve(!) different wines for only 20 &euro;.</p>

            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <img src = "images/hiking.jpeg" width= 50% height= auto>
                <p>We were able to go hiking several times during our trip to Santorini.  Sometimes it was 
                    on purpose and other times it was because the transportation never arrived (the buses
                    don't neccessarily stop for you).  Our second day there we went for a hike up to ancient Thira.
