            <p>In August 2015, I was able to take a trip to Santorini which has been 
                my favorite travel destination.  We stayed for 10 days, traveling around the small 
                island after first stopping in Athens for a day.  We were able to stay near 
                the beach, near the cliffside, and finally in the largest city, Fira.

                <h2>Sailing</h2>
            
                     <p>One evening, we embarked on a sunset sail where we enjoed food, drinks, snorkeling, 
                        swimming, and a beautiful view of the sunset.  We stopped at the "hot springs" for swimming 
                        (which was really just slightly warmer water).  We met a lot of fun people on the sail and 
                        went out for drinks afterwards with the newly appointed captain.

                <h2>Winery</h2>
            
                    <p>Santorini has many wineries to chose from, but we chose to visit one of the larger
                        wineries:Santo.  There was an amazing view of the volcano and we chose a wine tasting 
                        that include a "sampling" of twelve(!) different wines for only 20 &euro;. Afterwards, 
                        we took a tour of the winery and vinyards.

                <h2>Hiking</h2>
            
                    <p>We were able to go hiking several times during our trip to Santorini.  We first hiked up to 
                        the ancient city of Thira only accessible on foot which was a 3 hour hike.  Later in the trip while 
                        we stayed in a secluded part of the island we walked to the closest restaraunt...45 minutes away. 
                        On the way we saw some beautiful views and iconic blue-domed churches and even a wedding!

                <h2>Kayaking</h2>
            
                    <p>One of the days that we were in Santorini we went on an organized kayaking trip with a group of people.  
                        The best part of the trip was stopping at a secluded beach only accessible by boat and finding a small chapel
                        in the side of the cliff where we ate a delicious lunch.  The trip was also very informative as the guides
                        discussed how terrible pollution/litter is on some of the greek islands and how it affects wildlife.

                <h2>Beach</h2>
            
                    <p>Because of Santorini's volcano, the beaches in Santorini are mostly black Sand beaches.  While 
                        the beaches are not neccessarily what Santorini is known for, we had a nice time realaxing in the sun and going 
                        swimming.
